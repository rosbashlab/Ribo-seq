# Ribo-seq
Scripts needed to analyze Ribo-seq data from small numbers of Drosophila neurons


1. Ribo-seq_dm6_final_annotated.sh
   This script starts with the single end fastq file generated by sequencing and does the following:
     A. Runs fastqc to look at the quality of the library
     B. Trims the adaptor "TGGAATTCTCGGGTGCCAAGG" and sorts the reads into different bins by length.  <30 is tooshort >50 is toolong and keeps the justright reads that are between 30bp and 50bp.
     C. Number of reads with no adaptor, tooshort, toolong and justright are counted and output to a text file.  This file is updated throughout the script for bookkeeping.
     D.
